This suggests a respiratory tract infection.\n* **Physical examination**: Although the physical examination is largely normal, there are no specific findings that would rule out a pulmonary infection (e.g., pleural friction, dry or wet rales).\n* **Laboratory examination**:\n\t+ Elevated White Blood Cell count (8.3 *10^9/L) and C-Reactive Protein (64.51 mg/L), indicating an inflammatory response.\n\t+ Normal blood gas test results do not rule out a pulmonary infection.\n* **Imaging examination**: The plain computed tomography scan shows high-density strip-shaped shadows in the lungs, consolidation shadow in the right lower lobe, and thickened pleura on both sides. These findings are consistent with pneumonia or other types of pulmonary infections.\n* **Auxillary examination**: Not available, but not relevant to this differential diagnosis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a respiratory tract infection, making Pulmonary infection the most likely disease from the provided set.\n\nNote: Lung cancer and Tuberculosis are less likely given the acute presentation (3 days) and the presence of fever, which is more typical for infections.",
