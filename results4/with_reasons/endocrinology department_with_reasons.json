The patient's age and gender are relevant factors to be considered when determining the most likely disease.\n2. The duration of symptoms (9 years) suggests a chronic condition rather than an acute one.\n3. The effectiveness of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in alleviating the symptoms indicates that it might be related to inflammation or autoimmune issues, which are characteristic of psoriatic arthritis.\n4. The absence of obvious abnormalities on imaging suggests a non-degenerative condition like gouty arthritis rather than osteoarthritis.\n5. Elevated white blood cell count and the presence of an elevated C-reactive protein level suggest an inflammatory process, which is consistent with psoriatic arthritis or other autoimmune conditions but not typically seen in gouty arthritis.\n6. The lack of abnormalities on imaging rules out structural damage that would be more characteristic of osteoarthritis.\n7. Given the chronic nature, absence of trauma history and negative response to self-medication, a systemic inflammatory condition like psoriatic arthritis is likely. \n\nBased on these constraints:\n1. The patient's age (52 years old) may predispose them towards degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis but the chronicity and systemic inflammation markers point away from this diagnosis.\n2. The lack of trauma history reduces the likelihood of a simple injury or infection causing the symptoms, which would be more acute rather than recurring over 9 years.\n3. The patient's response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs suggests an inflammate condition that is not solely mechanical (as with osteoarthritis) but has a systemic component, which aligns more closely with psoriatic arthritis or other autoimmune conditions.\n4. The normal range of the blood test results does not indicate any metabolic disorder like gouty arthritis that would typically present with hyperuricemia and elevated uric acid levels, which are absent here.\n5. The lack of joint space abnormalities on imaging suggests a non-degenerative process rather than the degenerative changes seen in osteoarthritis.\n6. The systemic inflammation indicated by the lab results and the chronicity of symptoms, along with the response to anti-inflammatory medications, suggest an autoimmune etiology such as psoriatic arthritis rather than a mechanical or metabolic condition like gouty arthritis.\n\nBased on these considerations and given the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA). The patient's age does not preclude this diagnosis as it can occur in middle-aged individuals. The chronic nature of symptoms, systemic inflammation indicated by lab results, and response to anti-inflammatory drugs all point towards an autoimmune etiology rather than a degenerative or metabolic condition like gouty arthritis.\n\nHere is the patient's medical history: \nThe patient began experiencing bilateral ankle joint swelling and pain intermittently for nine years, which has recently worsened. The symptoms are not related to any known injury or trauma and have been partially relieved by dietary changes and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A recent exacerbation of pain in the left ankle joint has affected his mobility.\n\nThe patient's physical examination shows a red, swollen left ankle joint. Laboratory tests reveal:\n\nWBC 12.8 *10^9/L (normal range: 4-10 x10^9/L), Lymphocyte Percentage LYMPH% at 22.1 % (normal range: 20.0-50.0 %), Monocyte Percentage MONO% at 5.9 % (normal range: 3.0-10.0 %), Neutrophil Percentage NEUT% at 72.0 % (normal range: 40.0-75.0 %), Absolute Lymphocyte Count LYMPH# at 2.8 *10^9/L (normal range: 1.1-3.2), Absolute Monocyte Count MONO# at 0.76 *10^9/L (normal range: 0.10-0.60 x10^9/L), Platelet Count PLT-I at 269 *10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 *10^9/L), Mean Corpuscular Volume MCV at 101 fL (normal range: 80-100 fL), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin MCH at 35 pg (normal range: 27-34 pg), Platelet Distribution Width PDW-CV at 12.8 % (normal range: <15.0 %), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ESR at 57 mm/hr (normal range: <15 mm/hr), C-Reactive Protein CRP at 15.73 mg/L (normal range: <4.00 mg/L).\n\nThe system should also consider the following constraints in its analysis:\n- The patient's age and gender are relevant factors to be considered when determining the most likely disease from the provided list of diseases ['Gouty arthritis', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Psoriatic arthritis']."
