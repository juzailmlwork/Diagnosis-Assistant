This condition involves twisting of the ovary's blood supply, leading to severe pain and potential tissue death.\n2. **Corpus Luteum Rupture:** While less likely than torsion due to the severity and duration of pain, a ruptured corpus luteum can cause significant abdominal pain and bleeding into the peritoneal cavity (free fluid).\n\n**4.
