In children, type 1 diabetes is more common. The metabolic acidosis and high glucose levels could indicate diabetic ketoacidosis, a serious complication of diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State (HHS): This is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, and dehydration without significant ketoacidosis. However, this condition is more common in type 2 diabetes and in adults.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Inborn Errors of Metabolism: Certain metabolic disorders can present with similar symptoms and lab findings, including hyperglycemia and ketonuria. However, these are usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further diagnostic tests that could be helpful include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. HbA1c: This test measures the average blood glucose level over the past 2-3 months. It can help confirm a diagnosis of diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. C-Peptide and Insulin Autoantibodies: These tests can help differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Low C-peptide levels and the presence of insulin autoantibodies suggest type 1 diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Genetic Testing: If an inborn error of metabolism is suspected, genetic testing can help identify the specific disorder.\n"
