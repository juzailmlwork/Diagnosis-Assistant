This suggests a gradual onset of symptoms that could be related to a hematological disorder.\n* **Physical examination**: Severe anemia appearance, generalized pallor of skin and mucous membranes, pale conjunctiva, and no enlargement of superficial lymph nodes.

These values are consistent with megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by macrocytosis. Additionally, the patient's reticulocyte percentage is 2.9%, which suggests a bone marrow response to anemia.\n* **Anemia screening test**: The patient has low levels of vitamin B12 (63 pg/mL) and folic acid (2.0 ng/mL), which are essential for erythropoiesis.
