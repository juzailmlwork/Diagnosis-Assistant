      "   - **Reason:** The patient has experienced right-sided back pain, fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting, which are classic symptoms of acute pyelonephritis. The elevated white blood cell count and presence of bacteria in the urine further support this diagnosis.\n",
      "   - **Next Step:** Conduct a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to assess for any complications such as abscess formation or obstruction. Blood cultures should also be taken to rule out bacteremia.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Disease Name:** Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n",
      "   - **Reason:** The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes, which are significant risk factors for chronic kidney disease. Although the imaging examination did not show obvious abnormalities, the patient's recurrent infections and slightly abnormal hematocrit levels could suggest underlying chronic kidney issues.\n",
      "   - **Next Step:** Measure serum creatinine and calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to assess kidney function. Additionally, perform a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) test to check for proteinuria, which is a marker of kidney damage.\n",
