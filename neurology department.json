            "Vascular Parkinson's Syndrome: The typical Vascular Parkinson's Syndrome is characterized by lacunar infarctions in the deep white matter of both hemispheres, causing a wide-based shuffling and freezing gait disorder of PD, usually with a covert onset and stepwise progression. However, when infarctions involve the striatum or the basal ganglia region or substantia nigra of the striatum-pallidum-thalamus pathway, it can cause acute contralateral limb PD symptoms, and MRI examination can help with the diagnosis. But the diagnosis of vascular PKS needs to exclude PD, LBD or other neurodegenerative diseases causing PKS, these diseases have similar age of onset, can coexist in the form of comorbidity. That is, when neurodegenerative diseases show vascular damage neuroimaging evidence, it cannot be immediately confirmed that the vascular lesion is the responsible lesion, and cerebral vascular disease patients may also have neurodegenerative diseases.",
            "Progressive Supranuclear Palsy: The clinical features of PSP are characterized by vertical gaze palsy, and may also present with PKS, pseudobulbar palsy, dementia, etc., thus it is easy to distinguish from PD. Early PSP symptoms are more prominent in the neck and trunk, prone to postural instability and falls, while PD's postural instability rarely leads to falls. The gait instability of PSP patients is manifested as a wide base, which is different from the forward shuffling steps of PD; and resting tremor is rare in PSP. Bilateral limb movement slowness is relatively symmetrical."

However, infarctions involving the striatum or the basal ganglia region or substantia nigra of the striatum-pallidum-thalamus pathway can cause acute contralateral limb PD symptoms. MRI examination can assist in diagnosis. However, the diagnosis of vascular PKS needs to exclude PD, Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) or other neurodegenerative diseases causing PKS. These diseases have similar age of onset and can coexist in comorbidity. That is, when neurodegenerative diseases show evidence of vascular damage on neuroimaging, it cannot be immediately confirmed that the vascular lesion is responsible.

The gait instability in PSP patients presents as a broad-based stance, which is different from the festinating gait of PD. Resting tremor is rare in PSP.

The tremors were self-perceived and not visible to the naked eye. They worsened when the patient was emotionally agitated and slightly relieved when at rest. The patient also had difficulty moving, with slowed movements. The patient was treated with Levodopa (0.125g, 3 times\/day), Benazepril (1 tablet, 3 times\/day), and Amantadine (0.1g, 3 times\/day), which slightly improved the symptoms. The patient continued taking the medication, but 2 years ago, he started experiencing difficulty moving his right lower limb and lifting it was slightly strenuous. He could walk independently but had involuntary movements throughout the body before taking medication, which slightly relieved 30 minutes after taking medication. The symptoms slightly improved after adjusting the medication several times. A year ago, the symptoms progressively worsened, with dizziness, difficulty moving the left upper limb, and difficulty walking with both lower limbs. After adjusting Levodopa (0.125g, 4 times\/day) and Benazepril (1 tablet, 4 times\/day), the symptoms did not improve significantly. The patient was treated with combined Piribedil sustained-release tablets (50mg, 3 times\/day) half a year ago, but there was still no significant improvement.

The onset is usually insidious with stepwise progression. However, infarction involving the striatum or the basal ganglia region of the striatum-pallidum-thalamus pathway or the substantia nigra can cause acute contralateral PD symptoms. MRI examination can assist in diagnosis. However, the diagnosis of vascular PKS needs to exclude PKS caused by PD, Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) or other neurodegenerative diseases. These diseases have similar age of onset and can coexist in a comorbid form. That is, when neurodegenerative diseases show vascular damage neuroimaging evidence, it cannot be immediately confirmed that the vascular lesion is the responsible lesion. Patients with cerebrovascular diseases may also have neurodegenerative diseases.",
            "Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP): The clinical features of PSP are vertical gaze palsy, and can also present PKS, pseudobulbar palsy, dementia, etc., so it is easy to distinguish from PD. Early PSP symptoms are more prominent in the neck and trunk, prone to postural instability and falls, while PD's postural instability rarely leads to falls. The gait instability of PSP patients is manifested as a broad-based gait, which is different from PD's propulsive small shuffling steps, and PSP's resting tremor is rare. Bilateral limb movement slowness is relatively symmetrical."
